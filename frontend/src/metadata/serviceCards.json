        "q": "What encryption algorithm is used?",
        "a": "The tool uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). In standard mode it uses AES with a key derived via crypto-js. In server mode it uses PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 for key derivation and AES-256-CBC for encryption, compatible with the Jasypt library."

        "q": "What is Jasypt mode and when should I use it?",
        "a": "Jasypt is a popular Java encryption library used in Spring Boot applications to encrypt configuration properties. Use Jasypt mode when you need to generate or verify encrypted values for use in a Spring Boot application with the Jasypt Spring Boot starter."

      {
        "q": "Is AES encryption secure?",
        "a": "AES-256 is approved by the US National Security Agency for top-secret information and is considered secure when a strong and unique key is used. The security of your encrypted data depends entirely on the strength and secrecy of your key."

        "q": "Is my text or key sent to a server?",
        "a": "In server mode, encryption and decryption are performed on the server to match the Jasypt backend implementation, but your data is not stored. In standard mode, all operations are client-side only."
      },
      {
        "q": "What makes a good encryption key?",
        "a": "A strong key should be long (16+ characters), random, and contain a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Avoid dictionary words, names, or short numeric PINs as encryption keys."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I decrypt text that was encrypted with a different AES tool?",
        "a": "Interoperability depends on the exact mode, key derivation method, and padding scheme. The standard mode uses crypto-js defaults and the Jasypt mode targets Spring Boot compatibility. Encrypted text from an unrelated implementation may not decrypt correctly."
